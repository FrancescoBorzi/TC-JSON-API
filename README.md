## TrinityCore JSON REST API

This software provides an easy to use **RESTful API** for [TrinityCore](http://www.trinitycore.org/) available via HTTP, which delivers the most important database contents in simple **JSON format**. It is written using [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) PHP framework.

Our goal is to build a strong, reliable base on which you can build awesome web applications for TrinityCore (e.g. search engines, visual database editors, server administration tools, armories, etc...).

The JSON API makes it easier to build your web applications, because **you do not have to worry about accessing directly the database**, and the data are provided into a very friendly format for front-end web programming languages.

Also, a **single instance** of the TrinityCore JSON API can be a data provider for **multiple web applications**, even **among separated machines**.
